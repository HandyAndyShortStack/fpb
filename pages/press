"In that miniature Eden, musicians, friends, and lovers came and went like Orion in the night sky. -Fabulous Party Boys ‘Facebook Biography’<br />
<br />
It makes sense that I would find such eloquent prose inscribed on the Fabulous Party Boys’ Facebook page after witnessing their opening performance at the Wild Buffalo on May 19. Having never heard them before to my own fault, I was quite surprised by their sort of crazy swing dance swagger. Their raving ruffled shirts pinched back by the force of their savvy contemporary style of funk elicited fantasies of Michel de Montaigne; it was a merge between serious intellectual speculation, casual anecdotes, and personal narrative.<br />
<br />
The lion’s share of praise goes to no one because each member was excellent. Jon Hansen–tuba, for a lack of a better description, killed it. I’m not quite sure what he had attached to it but whatever he was doing it worked. His performance dragged me in. The deep base steamrolled my half-hearted day and woke me to life. The performance was solid. Scott Macpherson (sax) played the alluring sophisticated notes that had everyone moving every single inch of their body. His work prompted impromptu closeness of those standing just next to me–civilized sexual tension, if there is such a thing. Ray Larsen (trumpet) heralded like an army marching out into the desert to court a delicate flower in the oasis of their Eden. The voice of his trumpet could have brought the walls of Jericho down by itself. Andy Short (guitar) provided the necessary speed to keep the crowd’s fascination. I felt as though I was cruising to Chuckanut Ridge to spend the evening with a special friend–thrilling andanticipatory. Lastly, Marshall Petryni (drums) and Elliot Gray (keys), functioned as the heart and the soul respectively. Needless to say, the Fabulous Party Boys were brilliantly playful entertainers and musicians."<br />

"Try and listen to The Fabulous Party Boys without tapping your foot. Or dancing. Or snapping your fingers. It's literally impossible.<br />
<br />
The album, which drops today, is a wonderfully energetic and eccentric piece of funk that challenges how far people will go to have a good time and let loose. With roaring saxophone, keyboards, drums, tubs, trumpet and more, the band manages to radiate more soul in five seconds than most bands do in their entire career.<br />
<br />
"Business" opens with augmented, reverbed vocals and keyboards, setting the tone for seven-tracks of pure jazzy awesomeness. What's best, though, is the light-hearted nature of the whole affair. It genuinely seems each member is having the time of their life, shrilling away but creating a single, cohesive piece. Most importantly, it's fun. This is the type of album you throw on when you're doing anything: driving, cooking, or just lounging around the living room. It's hip and alive, without a sense of overwhelming urgency.<br />
<br />
Just be ready to dance. Oh man, there's no way NOT to dance.."<br />

“This young quintet of UW music school veterans has built a reputation around the state with their brand of jazzy, experimental funk. Ever seen a Tuba run through delay and distortion hold down the bass? Didn’t think so, don’t miss this one.”<br />

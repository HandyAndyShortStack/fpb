<p>
Born into the rich funk scene of Bellingham, Washington, The Fabulous Party Boys have been cultivating their own sound within the genre for more than a decade. Now based in Seattle, they are blending rock, soul, jazz, and electric tuba to create a new kind of party vibe. Their compositions are unique, stimulating, and always funky. Too groovy for standing still and engaging enough to intrigue the mind, each performance has something for the funkophile in all of us: positive lyrics, improvised solos, and a fun-loving attitude. With their funky beats and fat horns, The Fabulous Party Boys always leave you satisfied but wanting more.

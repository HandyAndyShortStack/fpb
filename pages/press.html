    "Try and listen to The Fabulous Party Boys without tapping your foot. 
    Or dancing. Or snapping your fingers. It's literally impossible. ... 
    Just be ready to dance. Oh man, there's no way NOT to dance.."

    "Their raving ruffled shirts pinched back by the force of their savvy 
    contemporary style of funk elicited fantasies of Michel de Montaigne; 
    it was a merge between serious intellectual speculation, casual anecdotes, 
    and personal narrative. ... Needless to say, the Fabulous Party Boys were 
    brilliantly playful entertainers and musicians."

    "[The Fabulous Party Boys] built a reputation around the state with 
    their brand of jazzy, experimental funk. Ever seen a Tuba run through 
    delay and distortion hold down the bass? Didn’t think so, don’t miss 
    this one.”

    "These boys stay fabulously fresh with a musical feel that is versatile 
    and changes in nearly every song, creating a very distinctive sound ... 
    Their name says it all – fabulous party funk is what 
    [The Fabulous Party Boys] bring to the stage."
